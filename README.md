### This repository consists of code and some notes I penned down as a part of the Phase 1 of AWS Machine Learning Nangodegree Scholarship Program : AWS Foundations course on Udacity 

How It Works
AWS and Udacity are collaborating to educate developers of all skill levels on Machine Learning concepts. We invite students 18 years of age or older who are interested in expanding their machine learning skills and expertise to enroll in the AWS Machine Learning Scholarship Program.

Your learning begins as soon as you complete your enrollment (enrollment opens on May 19). Scholarship recipients will spend 2.5 months in the AWS Machine Learning Foundations Course, studying machine learning techniques and algorithms, programming best practices, python coding, and AWS AI Services and AWS AI Devices, including Amazon SageMaker. The foundations course is intended to help developers of all skill levels get started with machine learning. When you successfully complete the course, you’ll be awarded with a certificate of completion.

At the end of the AWS Machine Learning Foundations Course, learners will take an assessment from which top students will be selected for one of 325 follow-up scholarships to one of Udacity’s most popular Nanodegree programs: AWS Machine Learning Engineer.
