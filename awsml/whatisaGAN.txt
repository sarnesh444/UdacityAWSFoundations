What are GANs?
GANs, a generative AI technique, pit 2 networks against each other to generate new content. The algorithm consists of two competing networks: a generator and a discriminator.

A generator is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns to create new data resembling the source data it was trained on.

The discriminator is another convolutional neural network (CNN) that is trained to differentiate between real and synthetic data.

The generator and the discriminator are trained in alternating cycles such that the generator learns to produce more and more realistic data while the discriminator iteratively gets better at learning to differentiate real data from the newly created data.

Like the collaboration between an orchestra and its conductor
The best way we’ve found to explain this is to use the metaphor of an orchestra and conductor. An orchestra doesn’t create amazing music the first time they get together. They have a conductor who both judges their output, and coaches them to improve. So an orchestra, trains, practices, and tries to generate polished music, and then the conductor works with them, as both judge and coach.

The conductor is both judging the quality of the output (were the right notes played with the right tempo) and at the same time providing feedback and coaching to the orchestra (“strings, more volume! Horns, softer in this part! Everyone, with feeling!”). Specifically to achieve a style that the conductor knows about. So, the more they work together the better the orchestra can perform.

The Generative AI that AWS DeepComposer teaches developers about uses a similar concept. We have two machine learning models that work together in order to learn how to generate musical compositions in distinctive styles.
