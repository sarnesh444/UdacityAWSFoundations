QUESTION 1 OF 2
Imagine you are writing a program that executes a number of tasks and categorizes each task based on its execution time. Below is a small snippet of this program. Which of the following naming changes could make this code cleaner?

t = end_time - start  # compute execution time
c = category(t)  # get category of task
print('Task Duration: {} seconds, Category: {}'.format(t, c)


THIS CODE CAN BE WELL WRITTEN BY:

Rename the variable start to start_time to make it consistent with end_time

Rename the variable t to execution_time to make it more descriptive

Rename the function category to categorize_task to match the part of speech

Rename the variable c to category to make it more descriptive
